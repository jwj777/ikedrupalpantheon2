00:05.186 --> 00:09.517
Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower

00:09.517 --> 00:11.926
faces a monumental decision

00:11.926 --> 00:16.225
whether or not to launch the D-Day invasion of France

00:16.225 --> 00:18.579
the largest and most complex

00:18.579 --> 00:21.013
military invasion in human history.

00:21.013 --> 00:24.920
The invasion had been delayed for 24 hours

00:24.920 --> 00:27.197
because of an unpredictable summer storm.

00:27.197 --> 00:30.095
The mood is tense

00:30.095 --> 00:32.892
everyone waits for the meteorologist’s report

00:32.892 --> 00:38.460
he states that there is a small window of opportunity.

00:38.460 --> 00:42.501
The weather will remain poor, but we could risk the invasion.

00:42.501 --> 00:46.300
Eisenhower peppers his commanders with questions

00:46.300 --> 00:48.876
going over every last detail.

00:48.876 --> 00:51.484
His Naval Commander worries

00:51.484 --> 00:54.224
about the condition of the seas and the high winds.

00:54.224 --> 00:57.080
Rough seas could sink the landing craft

00:57.080 --> 00:59.933
and drown the soldiers and sailors manning them.

00:59.933 --> 01:02.806
The invasion could become a disaster.

01:02.806 --> 01:06.881
His Air Chief fears that bad visibility

01:06.881 --> 01:10.682
from low cloud cover would lead his paratroopers

01:10.682 --> 01:11.775
to be dropped over too vast an area

01:11.775 --> 01:14.590
and then be annihilated by the Nazi forces.

01:14.590 --> 01:17.047
But Eisenhower knows

01:17.047 --> 01:20.003
that if he delays, secrecy will be difficult

01:20.003 --> 01:22.354
if not impossible, to maintain.

01:22.354 --> 01:23.856
And if the Germans learn where

01:23.856 --> 01:25.649
the invasion forces are landing

01:25.649 --> 01:28.427
there will be almost no chance of success.

01:28.427 --> 01:32.312
150,000 troops

01:32.312 --> 01:35.724
American, British, and Canadian, are massed along

01:35.724 --> 01:39.177
the English coast awaiting Eisenhower’s orders.

01:39.177 --> 01:42.183
There is complete silence in the room

01:42.183 --> 01:45.229
for several minutes as he contemplates the decision

01:45.229 --> 01:48.733
knowing that thousands or perhaps tens of thousands

01:48.733 --> 01:53.479
of Allied soldiers will likely have to die to overcome the enemy defenses

01:53.479 --> 01:55.682
but it has to be done.

01:55.682 --> 02:00.570
The fate of freedom in the world hangs in the balance.

02:00.570 --> 02:05.938
“Okay, we’ll go,” he says.

02:05.938 --> 02:07.715
They can’t afford to wait.

02:07.715 --> 02:10.915
Now there is no turning back.

02:10.915 --> 02:18.458
That evening, Eisenhower makes a surprise visit to the paratroopers

02:18.458 --> 02:23.291
of the U.S. 101st Airborne division shortly before they board their planes.

02:23.291 --> 02:26.229
He walks from group to group

02:26.229 --> 02:28.738
wishing them good luck and asking them

02:28.738 --> 02:31.196
where they’re from, searching for someone

02:31.196 --> 02:33.826
from his hometown of Abilene, Kansas.

02:33.826 --> 02:37.102
He never finds one that night.

02:37.102 --> 02:41.279
Before the invasion,

02:41.279 --> 02:43.660
Eisenhower had written a short message

02:43.660 --> 02:46.329
the Order of the Day, for the invasion troops.

02:46.329 --> 02:48.063
A copy of the message was

02:48.063 --> 02:50.791
provided to each soldier to take with him.

02:50.791 --> 02:55.437
Soldiers, sailors, and airmen

02:55.437 --> 02:57.432
of the Allied Expeditionary Force!

02:57.432 --> 03:00.169
You are about to embark

03:00.169 --> 03:01.335
upon the Great Crusade

03:01.335 --> 03:04.280
towards which we have striven these many months.

03:04.280 --> 03:07.735
The eyes of the world are upon you.

03:07.735 --> 03:11.003
The hopes and prayers

03:11.003 --> 03:13.131
of liberty-loving people everywhere

03:13.131 --> 03:14.809
march with you.

03:14.809 --> 03:18.259
In company with our brave allies

03:18.259 --> 03:20.496
and brothers in arms on other fronts

03:20.496 --> 03:23.428
you will bring about the destruction

03:23.428 --> 03:24.639
of the German war machine

03:24.639 --> 03:28.724
the elimination of Nazi tyranny

03:28.724 --> 03:30.292
over the oppressed peoples of Europe

03:30.292 --> 03:34.355
and security for ourselves in a free world.

03:34.355 --> 03:40.894
Your task will not be an easy one.

03:40.894 --> 03:43.772
Your enemy is well trained

03:43.772 --> 03:45.735
well equipped and battle-hardened.

03:45.735 --> 03:47.614
He will fight savagely.

03:47.614 --> 03:50.920
The tide has turned!

03:50.920 --> 03:53.302
The free men of the world

03:53.302 --> 03:55.209
are marching together to victory!

03:55.209 --> 03:59.346
I have full confidence in your courage

03:59.346 --> 04:01.303
devotion to duty and skill in battle.

04:01.303 --> 04:06.772
We will accept nothing less than full victory!

04:06.772 --> 04:09.445
Good luck!

04:09.445 --> 04:11.728
And let us all beseech the blessing

04:11.728 --> 04:12.771
of Almighty God

04:12.771 --> 04:15.780
upon this great and noble undertaking.

04:21.183 --> 04:23.688
Eisenhower nervously receives reports.

04:23.688 --> 04:26.775
Airborne casualties are far fewer

04:26.775 --> 04:27.955
than had been feared.

04:27.955 --> 04:31.504
British forces invading Sword and Gold beaches

04:31.504 --> 04:33.741
Canadian forces at Juno Beach

04:33.741 --> 04:36.264
and American forces at Utah Beach

04:36.264 --> 04:37.859
all capture their beaches.

04:40.099 --> 04:42.723
Worrisome news arrives from Omaha Beach.

04:42.723 --> 04:46.794
After six hours of fighting, the American forces there

04:46.794 --> 04:49.154
only cling to a few yards of the beach

04:49.154 --> 04:51.777
tied down by a barrage of artillery

04:51.777 --> 04:54.678
mortar, and machine-gun fire.

04:54.678 --> 04:58.497
Eventually, incredible acts of heroism

04:58.497 --> 05:00.260
by American soldiers and sailors

05:00.260 --> 05:02.877
overcome the Nazi defenses.

05:06.732 --> 05:10.262
Despite the loss of thousands of Allied troops

05:10.262 --> 05:12.992
the invasion is an astonishing success.

05:12.992 --> 05:16.664
The Allies have won the battle of D-Day

05:16.664 --> 05:18.524
and can now move men and equipment

05:18.524 --> 05:19.983
onto the continent.

05:19.983 --> 05:22.990
From the Normandy beaches

05:22.990 --> 05:25.802
the Allies would fight their way across Europe

05:25.802 --> 05:28.091
eventually crushing the Nazi armies

05:28.091 --> 05:30.155
and meeting up with Soviet forces

05:30.155 --> 05:32.905
advancing from the East less than a year later

05:32.905 --> 05:37.263
The most destructive war

05:37.263 --> 05:38.579
in the history of mankind

05:38.579 --> 05:40.242
was mercifully brought to an end

05:40.242 --> 05:43.156
through the courage and selflessness of the forces

05:43.156 --> 05:44.218
East and West

05:44.218 --> 05:47.423
determined to end the Nazi German regime.
