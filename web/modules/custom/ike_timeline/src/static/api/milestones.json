Following the President of Egypt Gamal Abdel Nasser&rsquo;s decision to nationalize the Suez Canal on July 26, 1956, the French, British, and Israelis began a tripartite military mobilization against Egypt. Eisenhower pressured Britain and France to accept a United Nations cease-fire. Eisenhower&rsquo;s handling of the Suez Crisis showed that he valued peace in the Middle East over protecting allied interests, as he barred even his closest allies from further military action.",
