<p>Regular television programming began in 1948 with many of the shows being adapted from their radio format such as <em>Gunsmoke</em> and <em>Our Miss Brooks</em>. Advertising played a big role in programming, then as now, and many anthology series and musical programs were named for their sponsors. By 1955, half of all households in the United States owned television sets.</p>
